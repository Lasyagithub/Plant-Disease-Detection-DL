Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning
Project Overview:
This project implements a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for plant disease classification using leaf images. It leverages transfer learning (VGG16) and image preprocessing techniques to detect plant diseases from the PlantVillage dataset. The model achieves high accuracy and can be used for real-world agricultural disease detection.
